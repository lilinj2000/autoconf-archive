@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_GLU
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Check for GLU. If GLU is found, the required preprocessor and linker
flags are included in the output variables "GLU_CFLAGS" and "GLU_LIBS",
respectively. If no GLU implementation is found, "no_glu" is set to
"yes".

If the header "GL/glu.h" is found, "HAVE_GL_GLU_H" is defined. If the
header "OpenGL/glu.h" is found, HAVE_OPENGL_GLU_H is defined. These
preprocessor definitions may not be mutually exclusive.

You should use something like this in your headers:

@smallexample
  # if defined(HAVE_WINDOWS_H) && defined(_WIN32)
  #  include <windows.h>
  # endif
  # if defined(HAVE_GL_GLU_H)
  #  include <GL/glu.h>
  # elif defined(HAVE_OPENGL_GLU_H)
  #  include <OpenGL/glu.h>
  # else
  #  error no glu.h
  # endif
@end smallexample

Some implementations (in particular, some versions of Mac OS X) are
known to treat the GLU tesselator callback function type as "GLvoid
(*)(...)" rather than the standard "GLvoid (*)()". If the former
condition is detected, this macro defines "HAVE_VARARGS_GLU_TESSCB".
